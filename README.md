# Lottery_System

The lottery program is written in the Java language. The program is divided into three components, namely the setting interface, the running interface and the result interface. The setting interface is used to read the text file containing the lottery objects, edit the title performed by the user, and set whether the lottery name can be repeated; the running interface displays a rolling list during the lottery; the results interface displays the winning list in the order of the lottery. The lottery program can be applied to multiple occasions, such as company annual meetings, organizational activities, random roll call of classes, etc.
